    <td>Python is used everyday, you may not realise it, but many video games are created using python. Python is a programming language. To learn this language, we are using a website called repl.it. This is an amazing website that allows us to code whenever we want (if we have internet connection)

If you want to learn more, here is a video by the hello world program on what is python?:

    <td>In today's lesson we moved away from drawing with turtle and worked on creating a questionnaire in Python3. We used functions such as the if function, the while function and the print function. We were asking for user input and creating a computer program which the user could interact with. The computer program learnt about the user and stored information in variables. My computer program was an artificial intelligence which the user could talk to and the computer would take information and use it later on by recalling from variables.

    <td>In today's lesson we struggled with working out how to have a variable which used two different types of data (string and integer). This was very difficult because when the user inputted their age, the computer would store it as string data. However later on I wanted the computer to work out how many seconds old the user would be on their next birthday. Multiplication requires the data to be integer data and the variable stored the data as string data. I tackled this problem for a long time and I think I wouldâ€™ve been more productive if I had used the resources around me (the Internet) to find a solution to my problem and move on to produce more work.</td>
