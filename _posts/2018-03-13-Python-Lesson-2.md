    <td>Python is used everyday, you may not realise it, but many video games are created using python. Python is a programming language. To learn this language, we are using a website called repl.it. This is an amazing website that allows us to code whenever we want (if we have internet connection)

If you want to learn more, here is a video by the hello world program on what is python?:

    <td>After signing up to repl.it, were given the task to create one of the simplest shapes there is, a triangle. First, we had to import turtle. This allowed us to have a little turtle on our screen that could draw lines. Using the turtle.forward(), turtle.backward(), turtle.left() and turtle.right() commands, we were able to move the turtle forwards, backwards, left and right. 

However, our task was to create a triangle. To do this I told my python to go forwards 100 pixels. Then, it turned left 60 degrees, then it went forward 100 and went left 60, then finally forward 100 and left 60. My code looked something like this:


However, with some perseverance, I realised this could simply be re-written. This used the "for i in range()" statement. My final outcome then looked like this:


Our next task was to start on the left hand side, draw a triangle, then draw a square, then draw a pentagon. This introduced the penup() and pendown() commands which stopped and started the turtle from drawing on the page. This allowed us to create 3 separate shapes, looking like this:

Next we were to create a sort of formula for an “n” sides shape. This used variables. We had two variables, length and sides. Using everything I have learnt so far, my code then looked like this:


Our final task was to make the turtle draw our name. This is quite easy for me as I have a very short, simple name, Jack. This did require a lot of perseverance however. I found the J easy, just a line at the top, a line going down and then a small curve. However, the a was a bit harder. I wanted to do a lowercase a, however, there are so many different fonts and types of a's. In the end, I went for the simple circle-ish shape with a curve in the bottom right hand corner. I found the C easy, just one big curve. The K was also easy, just 3 lines, however, getting the angles right took a bit of trying. I did find it hard to try and get ll of the letters to have the same height be in the same row and be the same distance away from each other. In the end, my name looked like this:
