    <td>Python is used everyday, you may not realise it, but many video games are created using python. Python is a programming language. To learn this language, we are using a website called repl.it. This is an amazing website that allows us to code whenever we want (poviding we have internet connection)

If you want to learn more, here is a video by the hello world program on what is python?:

    <td><br>Right at the beginning of the lesson, I leart many new commands. These included: wn=turtle.Screen(), wn.bgcolor("lightblue"), t.begin_fill(), t.fillcolor("pink").The first of these commands allows us to just type wn instead of turtle.Screen(). The second allows us to use the wn but also changes the back ground colour to any colour of our chosing. In thhis exmaple, I chose light blue, however, you can tyoe any colour you want by name or also use hexadecimal to enter any colour. After this, we can make the turtle, not just draw a shape but fill it in with anny colour of our choosinf, and again, we could type this colour or use hexadecimal. In this example I choose pink. Using all of these command, you can make something that looks like this:

<br>I also learnt how to type my code faster using shortcuts. in python, there are multiples ways to say one thing, it is not like maths where there is only 1 correct answer. for example to speed up me typing my code, Instead of typing turtle.forward(100) I could say t=turtle and then t.forward(100).I could speed this uo even further using t.fd(100), in which fd is a shortcut for forward. here is a list of shortcuts:

<br>Finding out these shortcuts took my a while to research, it really made me persevere when things didnt go my way however.

<br>However, our task for the lesson was to create our name using bubble writing. I had already written my name in my first lesson, I have written a blog on it  <a href="https://jackm245.github.io/python-lesson-1/"> Here </a>

Next we were to create a sort of formula for an “n” sides shape. This used variables. We had two variables, length and sides. Using everything I have learnt so far, my code then looked like this:

Our final task was to make the turtle draw our name. This is quite easy for me as I have a very short, simple name, Jack. This did require a lot of perseverance however. I found the J easy, just a line at the top, a line going down and then a small curve. However, the a was a bit harder. I wanted to do a lowercase a, however, there are so many different fonts and types of a's. In the end, I went for the simple circle-ish shape with a curve in the bottom right hand corner. I found the C easy, just one big curve. The K was also easy, just 3 lines, however, getting the angles right took a bit of trying. I did find it hard to try and get ll of the letters to have the same height be in the same row and be the same distance away from each other. In the end, my name looked like this:
