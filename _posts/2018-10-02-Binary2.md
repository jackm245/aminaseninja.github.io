Everytime you want to multiply something by 2, you do a binary shift. This is where you move everything to the left by 1 column.

	

	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	x2

	

=

	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0

Therefore, if you want to divide by 2, then you do a binary shift to the right.

	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0 	 ÷2

=

	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	

	

8 bits = 256 things = 2^8. Although we can only have a maximum number of 255 with 8 bits, we can have 256 things, including 0.

bits and Bytes

bits needs lowercase b. Bytes needs uppercase B.

8bits = 1B

1024B=1MB

1024kB=1MB

1024MB= 1GB

1024GB=TB

	=pB

	=exabyte

	=Zeta

	=yotta

The technically mathematical values is 1024, however, it can be 1000 as well, however, this is not 100% accurate.

A FLOP is  floating point operation. A flop is a calculation.

2^8 = 8bit = 256

2^16=16bit=65,536

2^32=32bit=4,294,967,296

2^64=64bit=184,467,440,700,000,000,000

32 bit is a rounding error of 64 bit. This shows how big the 64 bit number is.

Decimals with bits work like this

2^2| 2^1|2^0|	|2^-1|2^-2|2^-3|

4       2     1    0 ½     ¼      ⅛ 

With This, you can never get ⅓. This means that it is very inaccurate. For example, in banks, this small amount, for every calculation, adds up over time.
