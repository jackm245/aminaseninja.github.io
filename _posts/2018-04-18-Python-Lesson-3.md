    <td>Python is used everyday, you may not realise it, but many video games are created using python. Python is a programming language. To learn this language, we are using a website called repl.it. This is an amazing website that allows us to code whenever we want (if we have internet connection)

If you want to learn more, here is a video by the hello world program on what is python?:

    <td>Python is used everyday, you may not realise it, but many video games are created using python. Python is a programming language. To learn this language, we are using a website called repl.it. Today was our third lesson use turtle and I feel like I have improved a lot. Some people carried on with turtle but I went on to making a conversation with python which went very well. Some of the code looked like this: years = input("How old are you this year? \n") seconds = years * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 print "Oh my! You will be", seconds, "seconds old on your birthday!!"
