    <td>Python is used everyday, you may not realise it, but many video games are created using python. Python is a programming language. To learn this language, we are using a website called repl.it. This is an amazing website that allows us to code whenever we want (if we have internet connection)

If you want to learn more, here is a video by the hello world program on what is python?:

    <td>This lesson, with the help of the fabulous IT/CS teacher that we have; I, along with my classmates managed to create a generic buzzfeed quiz. This script was a sort of template that could then be used to insert a question of your own with relative ease. This script consisted of many items such as lists, functions and many if statements. The main questioning part of the code consisted of a function called ask_question, this came with the arguments of question, a, b, c and d. The first thing  that this function did was to ask a question, it did this by printing the argument question. It then printed the arguments A, B, C and D respectively  with the answer that they were attached to. We then used a loop in the form of a While True: to run a series of if statements asking itself what the person taking the test had inputted. Then, out of the function a list is created called question1, this contained 4 items, These were the question, answer answer b, answer c and answer d, this is the same as the arguments in the function, but it actually says the question. After we had made a list for all four questions, we needed to use these list. We did this by making another list which contained the items, question1, question2, question3 and question4. You may have not realised, but what we did was create a series if lists, inside a list. However, we needed to use this list inside of a list so that our buzzfeed quiz could work. We did this by creating a function called ask_the_questions. This contained no arguments. This contained a for statements saying for item in list_of_questions: ask_question(item[0], item[1], item[2], item[3], item[4]). We did this so that we could rint a question and then the multiple choice answers for the user to choose from. The final thing to do was to say ask_the_questions() which brought everything together and asked the user a question

    <td>In today's lesson we struggled with working out how to have a variable which used two different types of data (string and integer). This was very difficult because when the user inputted their age, the computer would store it as string data. However later on I wanted the computer to work out how many seconds old the user would be on their next birthday. Multiplication requires the data to be integer data and the variable stored the data as string data. I tackled this problem for a long time and I think I would’ve been more productive if I had used the resources around me (the Internet) to find a solution to my problem and move on to produce more work.</td>
