CPU

The central processing unit  is the part of a computer that interprets and carries out the instructions which are needed for the computer to work

RAM-Random access memory

RAM is the computer's main memory. The computer uses RAM constantly to temporarily store information while it is working with it. Short term storage. When you load a computer it moves storage into the RAM. RAM is volatile, if the computer turns off, you lose what is stored in the RAM.

ROM - read only memory

Non volatile memory. The BIOS is stored on ROM chips.

Motherboard

The motherboard is like a big city with many streets and roads that connect all of the buildings together. Instead of streets and highways, the motherboard uses tiny electrical paths to connect each component of the computer together.All the components are attached to the motherboard.

ECI Expansion

An expansion bus is an assortment of wires that allows for computer expansion with the use of an expansion board, a printed circuit board inserted into an expansion slot on the motherboard that provides additional features to a computer.

North bridge

Von neumann architecture.

Connects to other parts of a computer. Northbridge is al [chipset](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/chipset) that communicates with the computer [processor](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/processor) and controls interaction with memory. Closer to CPU, faster.

South Bridge

Southbridge is al [chipset](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/chipset) that manages the basic forms of input/output. Further away from cpu than north, slower.

BIOS

BIOS is short  for basic input/output system, which is the built-in [software](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/software.html) that determines what a [computer](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/computer.html) can do without accessing [programs](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/program.html) from a [disk](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/disk.html). Stored on ROM chips

Storage

Data storage is the collective methods that capture and keep digital information stored in a certain place.

**Vocab**

A bus is a path that carries data to the cpu and across the computer.

SATA stands for serial ATA which is an advanced technology attachment.

If to drives are mirrored, then the contents of A would be identical to B. There is a thing called striping where half of the data would be on A and half would be on B, this is best used with 3 drives.

A peripheral item ,such as the keyboard and mouse outside the computer.

Null is an absence of anything

**STANDARD: This is a ****hardware**** type. A hardware standard would be something like HDMI, USB, lightning etc… This is a physical item that has a name that is well known and used and is used to plug something in to another, allowing them to ****communicate****.                                                                                 **

**PROTOCOL: This is a ****software**** type. Is the transfer of information between any two  computers. HTTP is a hypertext transfer protocol. FTP is File Transfer Protocol. They are agreed ways of ****communicating**** between different computers.**

Digital signal uses 0 as low voltage and  1 as high voltage. It uses timeframes to gets a series of 1's and 0’s

Analogue signal is like sound waves and goes above and below 0 which is at rest.

SSL stands for secure socket layers. It assures people that you are who you say you are. They must be bought. The buyers information will not be given to bad people or can not be taken by them.
